**MELT ELECTROCODER**

This application was developed for generating melt electrowriting (MEW) compatible g-code. The application can generate g-code for both flat and tubular collectors, with multiple inbuilt designs and options for applying toolpath correction to mitigate jet lag effects.

**Features**
  - Generate g-code for flat and tubular collectors
  - Multiple inbuilt designs
  - Toolpath correction to mitigate jet lag effects

**Instructions**

  - Download the Melt-ElectroCoder application zipped folder
  - Unzip the folder and install it to the desired location
  - Run the app.mlapp file
  - On generating g-code, files will be saved in the UserExports folder in the Melt-ElectroCoder location

**Contributing and Feedback**

We developed this application as part of our PhD research. Since our team consists of researchers and not professional software engineers, there may be some initial bugs and compatibility issues with different operating systems and MATLAB versions. We greatly appreciate your understanding and encourage your feedback to help us improve the application.

**Reporting Issues**

If you encounter any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, please:

  - Open an issue on our GitHub repository
  - Provide as much detail as possible, including your operating system, MATLAB version, and steps to reproduce the issue
  - Updates and fixes will be released periodically

**Contributing**

We encourage users to take this software and run with it! Feel free to:
  - Fork the repository
  - Make any changes or additions you like
  - Submit pull requests with your improvements

This software is intended to be a baseline starting point for MEW innovation. We believe in the power of community-driven development and look forward to seeing how the community can enhance and expand upon our work.
