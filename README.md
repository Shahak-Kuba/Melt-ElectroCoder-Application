# Melt-ElectroCoder-Application

This application was developed for generating melt electrowriting (MEW) compatible g-code. The application can generate g-code for both flat and tubular collectors, with multiple inbuilt designs and options for applying toolpath correction to mitigate jet lag effects. 

Instructions:
1. Download Melt ElectroCoder application zipped folder
2. Unzip folder and install to desired location
3. Open MATLAB and run a change directory command to the Melt ElectroCoder folder location
4.   Example: cd 'C:\Users\user\Downloads\Melt-ElectroCoder-Application-main'
5. Run the app.mlapp file
6. On generating g-code, files will be saved in UserExports folder in the Melt ElectroCoder location

*Updates will be released periodically
